Python Script for USB Device to Backup Computer (Work in Progress) 

A year ago while messing around with a rasberry pie I accidently burnt the image to the wrong device. I love all of my files. The idea is that instead of having to use a cloud based service or an expensive backup external device, you can plug in a USB and an automatic backup would begin.
